# godot-3.x-pointlight-shadow-demo

Spent the afternoon *tinkering*, the vast majority of the scene is coded using the GDScript API, except for the shade around the light which is a CSGMesh (i didn't know how to do this in code so i built it quickly in the editor and instantiated it in the main script)

Very basic little demo, the lighting is all *as it comes* by default, no GIProbe, no GLSL, no PBR workflow, texturing etc, so there is much more that can be done to improve this, i wouldn't recommend anyone using this, i've probably made mistakes or not used the best *godot practices*, but i had fun and learned a few new things and i'm actually very impressed with how easy it is to get started using the [godot engine](https://godotengine.org)


it looks like this:
